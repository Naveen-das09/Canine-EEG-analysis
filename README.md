# EEG Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for EEG analysis. The project focuses on preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of EEG signals. 
The pipeline is implemented in a Python Jupyter Notebook and includes all relevant processes to analyze EEG data effectively.

## Introduction

EEG (Electroencephalography) is a method to record electrical activity of the brain. This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline to preprocess, extract features, and classify EEG signals. The pipeline can be used for various applications, including cognitive neuroscience research and medical diagnosis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes noise filtering, artifact removal, and normalization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from the EEG signals for classification.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilizes techniques such as PCA for reducing the feature space.
- **Classification:** Implements various machine learning models to classify EEG signals.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of the EEG signals and the results of the classification.
